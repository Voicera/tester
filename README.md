Lightweight test utilities to use with Go's testing package.

## Features
* Assertions that make testss easier to read, write, and debug
* Streamlined data providers for data-driven testing (DDT)
* Test hooks' hygiene check

## Motivations
Most tests follow the same pattern: set up, invoke the unit under test, assert,
then clean up (if need be); said pattern encourages code reuse and consistency.
By using test utilities, you can spend more time thinking about test stratigies
and less time typing boilerplate code.

## Quick Start
Get the latest version (`go get -u github.com/workfit/tester`) then test away:

    package hitchhiker

    import (
        "testing"
        "github.com/workfit/tester/assert"
    )

    func TestDeepThought(t *testing.T) {
        computer := NewDeepThoughtComputer()
        answer, err := computer.AnswerTheUltimateQuestion()
        if assert.For(t).ThatActual(err).IsNil().Passed() {
            assert.For(t).ThatActual(answer).Equals(42)
        }
    }

### Assertions
Package `assert` provides a more readable way to assert in test cases;
for example:

    assert.For(t).ThatCalling(fn).PanicsReporting("expected error")

This way, the assert statement reads well; it flows like a proper sentence.

In addition, one can easily tell which value is the test case got (actual)
and which it wanted (expected); this is key to printing the values correctly
to make debugging a bit easier. In Go, the actual value is usually printed
first; for example:

    assert.For(t).ThatActual(foo).Equals(expected)

The above enforces said order in both reading the code and the assertion failure
message (if any).

For convenience (that also improves readability), there are methods for special
cases like:

    assert.For(t).ThatActual(foo).IsTrue()
    assert.For(t).ThatActualString(bar).IsEmpty()

Which are equivalent to:

    assert.For(t).ThatActual(foo).Equals(true)
    assert.For(t).ThatActual(len(bar)).Equals(0)

To identify a test case in a table-driven test, optional ID parameters can be
specified and will be included in failure messages:

	cases := []struct {
		id       string
		actual   interface{}
		expected interface{}
	}{
		{"different values", 42, 13},
		{"different types", 42.0, 42},
		{"different containers", [...]int{42}, []int{42}},
	}

	for _, c := range cases {
		assert.For(t, c.id).ThatActual(c.actual).Equals(c.expected)
	}

After an assertion is performed, a `ValueAssertionResult` is returned to allow
for post-assert actions to be performed; for example:

    assert.For(t).ThatActual(value).Equals(expected).ThenDiffOnFail()

Which will pretty-print a detailed recursive diff of both objects on failure.

It also can be used as a condition to perform extra test steps:

    value := GetValue()
    if assert.For(t).ThatActual(value).IsNotNil().Passed() {
        assert.For(t).ThatActual(value.GetFoo()).Equals(expected)
    }

Or to perform a deeper analysis of the test values:

    if !assert.For(t).ThatActual(value).Equals(expected).Passed() {
        analyze(value, expected) // e.g., analyze may look at common bugs
    }

Conveniently, the last example above can be rewritten as:

    assert.For(t).ThatActual(value).Equals(expected).ThenRunOnFail(analyze)

Another use is to print a custom failure message:

    assert.For(t).ThatActual(foo).Equals(bar).ThenRunOnFail(func(actual, expected interface{}) {
		fmt.Printf("JSON: %q != %q", actual.ToJSON(), expected.ToJSON())
	})

The above pattern allows for reuse of post-failure analysis and cleanup.

The interfaces in this package are still a work-in-progress, and are subject
to change.

### Test Hooks
What exists merely for test code to see shall not be exported to the world.
You can tag test-hook fields like the following:

    type sleeper struct {
        sleep func(time.Duration) `test-hook:"verify-unexported"`
    }

Using tags, instead of comments, enables you to search the codebase for test
hooks and validate,Â via reflection, that they're not exported.
A test case should be added to verify that test hooks are hidden:

    func TestHooksAreHidden(t *testing.T) {
        assert.For(t).ThatType(reflect.TypeOf(sleeper{})).HidesTestHooks()
    }

### Data-Driven Testing (DDT)
When the number of test cases in a table-driven test gets out of hand and they
cannot fit neatly in structs anymore, the use of a data provider is in order.
Package `ddt` provides a way to load test cases from a JSON file whose path
is derived from the caller's test function name and file. The file path is
`<package under test>/_ddt/<basename of test file>.json`; for example,
`hitchhiker/_ddt/question_test.json` with the following schema:

    {
      "testFunctions": {
        "<name of test function>": [
          {
            <properties of the test case to unmarshal>
          }
        ]
      }
    }

For example, the JSON content may look like the following:

    {
      "testFunctions": {
        "TestDeepThought": [
          {
            "id": "The Ultimate Question",
            "input": {
              "question": "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?",
              "timeoutInHours": 65700000000,
              "config": {"base": 13}
            },
            "expected": {
              "answer": "42",
              "error": null
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }

The details of the test case struct are left for the tester to specify.
